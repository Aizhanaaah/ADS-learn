# ADS-learn
I will put anything and everything which I learn about algorithms and data-structures. It will be a great journey which embraces my skills and abilitites in software engineering.
As someone who is a beginner in coding, I promise myself to get involved with it every single day and expand my knowledges.
In the future I wanna be a part of one responsible tech-team, therefore I gotta keep up of what is going on in our life. 

I want to get in to a Big Tech and earn lots of moneyyyyyy. Also create cool tools for everything and everyone. If I get better enough in the education that I have just started, then I will be so happy, it means I am actually getting out of my comfort zone intellectually.
